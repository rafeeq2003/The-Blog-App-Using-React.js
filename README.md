# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm install
```

Installs all the required dependencies for the project. Make sure to run this before starting the project.

```bash
cd project-name
```

Navigate to the project folder. Replace `project-name` with the actual name of your project.

```bash
npx json-server --watch db.json --port 8000
```

Starts the JSON server to mock API endpoints.  
Make sure you have a `db.json` file in your project directory. The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes to the code.  
You can also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Use this to run unit tests and ensure your code works as expected.

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
The app is optimized for the best performance and is ready to be deployed.

The build process includes minification, and the filenames include hashes for cache management.

## Notes

- Before starting the JSON server, ensure that `json-server` is installed globally or as a dev dependency in your project. You can install it using:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

- Ensure the `db.json` file is configured correctly to mock your data.

Feel free to modify this documentation as per your project's requirements!
